- Learn Locators (CSS, text, role, nth)

- Practice finding elements with page.locator()

### Day 7:

- Recap ### Week 1 by writing 3 small tests:

## Week 2 â€“ Test Writing & Best Practices

- Goal: Gain fluency in writing structured tests.

### Day 8:

- Understand beforeEach & afterEach hooks

- Set up browser/page lifecycle

### Day 9:

- Learn about test.describe() for grouping tests

- Organize tests into suites

### Day 10:

- Explore built-in fixtures (browser, context, page)

- Use multiple contexts (for different users)

### Day 11:

- Learn how to handle inputs: typing, clicking, checkboxes, dropdowns

### Day 12:

- Work with waits: waitForSelector(), auto-waiting, timeouts

- Understand flaky tests & how Playwright avoids them

### Day 13:

- Take screenshots & videos on test failures

- Learn to use npx playwright show-trace

### Day 14:

- Mini-project: Write a login + logout test for a demo site

## Week 3 â€“ Advanced Features

- Goal: Master Playwrightâ€™s advanced capabilities.

### Day 15:

- Page Object Model (POM) basics

- Create a LoginPage class and use it in tests

### Day 16:

- Handle API testing with Playwright (request fixture)

- Write test for GET and POST API

### Day 17:

- Handle file uploads & downloads in tests

### Day 18:

- Mocking network requests (e.g., intercept API responses)

### Day 19:

- Learn about test configuration (playwright.config.js)

- Set up retries, parallelism, and test-specific configs

### Day 20:

- Run tests in different browsers/devices (mobile emulation)

### Day 21:

- Mini-project: E2E checkout flow test (search â†’ add to cart â†’ checkout)

## Week 4 â€“ CI/CD & Scaling

- Goal: Learn professional workflows for test automation at scale.

### Day 22:

- Explore Playwright Test Reports (HTML, JSON, Allure)

### Day 23:

- Integrate Playwright with GitHub Actions (basic CI setup)

### Day 24:

- Explore parallel execution & sharding tests

### Day 25:

- Learn about environment variables & test data management

### Day 26:

- Use dotenv for config handling (URLs, creds, etc.)

### Day 27:

- Best practices for structuring test folders, pages, and utils

### Day 28:

- Review and improve Page Object Model with reusable components

### Day 29:

- Final project: Automate login â†’ navigate â†’ perform CRUD actions â†’ logout (choose a demo app like saucedemo.com
)

### Day 30:

- Recap everything

- Document what youâ€™ve built



## Identify next steps (API-heavy testing, Playwright with TypeScript, or integrating with Docker/Jenkins)

âš¡ By the end of 30 Days (just 1 hour/Day), youâ€™ll be able to:

- Write robust UI & API tests with Playwright
- Use POM for scalability
- Run tests in parallel across browsers/devices
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
